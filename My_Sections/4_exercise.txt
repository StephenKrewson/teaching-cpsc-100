Exercise

1. What will print?

// Address of x is 0x1b in memory
// sizeof(int) = 4

int x = 4;
int* y = &x;

x += 5;
y += 3;

x will print as ? 9
y will print as ? 0x28

2. Good or bad code snippet? Why?

char* buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1024);

if (buffer == NULL)
{
    exit(1);    
}

char* input = GetString();

memcpy(buffer, input, sizeof(input) + 1);

free(input);
return EXIT_SUCCESS;

// Danger 1: buffer overflow. Run with valgrind ./4_code < /usr/bin/dict
// input does not have the same address as buffer so we need to free both

3. What's a disadvantage of merge sort?

4. The contents of my_file.txt are "hello, world!\EOF". What happens when I run

    $ echo "from CS50" >> my_file.txt

at the command line?

5. (Extra Credit) Write out the first 24 bits (leftmost) bits of ~(-1).
